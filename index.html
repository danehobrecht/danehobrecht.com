									into her meat pies that has the people of London
									lining up... and the carnage has only just begun!
									<br><br>Extremely popular with opera companies and

									When Ren and his mother move from Chicago to a small
									farming town, he is prepared for the inevitable
									adjustment period at his new high school. But he’s
									not prepared for the rigorous local edicts,
									including a ban on dancing instituted by the local

									daughter sets her sights on Ren, her roughneck
									boyfriend tries to sabotage Ren’s reputation, with
									many of the locals eager to believe the worst about
									the new kid. The heartfelt story that emerges pins a
									father longing for the son he lost against a young
									man aching for the father who walked out on him.<br>
									<br>To the rockin’ rhythm of its Oscar and
									Tony-nominated Top 40 score, augmented with dynamic

									<i>Our Town</i> is a 1938 metatheatrical
									three-actplay by American playwright Thornton
									Wilder. It tells the story of the fictional American
									small town of Grover's Corners between 1901 and 1913
									through the everyday lives of its citizens.<br><br>
									Throughout, Wilder uses metatheatrical devices,
									setting the play in the actual theatre where it is
									being performed. The main character is the stage
									manager of the theatre who directly addresses the
									audience, brings in guest lecturers, fields
									questions from the audience, and fills in playing
									some of the roles. The play is performed without a
									set on a mostly bare stage. With a few exceptions,
									the actors mime actions without the use of props.
									<br><br>The first performance of <i>Our Town</i> was
									at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey on
									January 22, 1938. It went on to success on Broadway
									and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Described
									by Edward Albee it is "the greatest American play
									ever written". <i>Our Town</i> is popular today with
									frequent revivals.
