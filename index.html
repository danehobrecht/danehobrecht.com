									Laguna Playhouse Youth Theatre presents <i>The 
									Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical</i>, an
									action-packed mythical adventure "worthy of the
									gods" (Time Out New York). As the half-blood son of

									and Percy becomes the prime suspect, he goes on a
									quest to return the bolt, prove his innocence and
									prevent a war between the gods.<br><br>Adapted from
									the best-selling book The Lightning Thief by Rick
									Riordan and featuring a thrilling original rock
									score, <i>The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson
									Musical</i> is a killer quest that will have you

									<i>Sweeney Todd</i> has become a bloody, worldwide
									success since being awarded eight Tony's, (including
									Best Musical), for its Broadway premiere. Stephen
									Sondheim's and Hugh Wheeler's (A Little Night Music,
									Pacific Overtures) tasty, thrilling, theatrical
									treat has simultaneously shocked, awed and delighted
									audiences across the world.<br><br>An infamous tale,
									Sweeney Todd, an unjustly exiled barber, returns to
									nineteenth century London, seeking vengeance against
									the lecherous judge who framed him and ravaged his
									young wife. The road to revenge leads Todd to Mrs.
									Lovett, a resourceful proprietress of a failing pie
									shop, above which, he opens a new barber practice.
									Mrs. Lovett's luck sharply shifts when Todd's thirst
									for blood inspires the integration of an ingredient
									into her meat pies that has the people of London
									lining up... and the carnage has only just begun!
									<br><br>Extremely popular with opera companies and
									in concert presentation, <i>Sweeney Todd</i> is
									equally effective as an intimate chamber musical.
									Featuring two unforgettable star turns and some of
									the most chilling music ever written for the stage,
									this masterpiece is sure both to thrill and delight
									audiences.

									When Ren and his mother move from Chicago to a small
									farming town, he is prepared for the inevitable
									adjustment period at his new high school. But he’s
									not prepared for the rigorous local edicts,
									including a ban on dancing instituted by the local
									preacher, who is determined to exercise control over
									the town’s youth. When the reverend’s rebellious
									daughter sets her sights on Ren, her roughneck
									boyfriend tries to sabotage Ren’s reputation, with
									many of the locals eager to believe the worst about
									the new kid. The heartfelt story that emerges pins a
									father longing for the son he lost against a young
									man aching for the father who walked out on him.<br>
									<br>To the rockin’ rhythm of its Oscar and
									Tony-nominated Top 40 score, augmented with dynamic
									new songs, <i>Footloose</i> celebrates the wisdom of
									listening to young people while guiding them with a
									warm heart and open mind.

									James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim take everyone's
									favorite storybook characters and bring them
									together for a timeless, yet relevant, piece... and
									a rare modern classic. The Tony Award-winning book
									and score are both enchanting and touching.<br><br>
									The story follows a Baker and his wife, who wish to
									have a child; Cinderella, who wishes to attend the
									King's Festival; and Jack, who wishes his cow would
									give milk. When the Baker and his wife learn that
									they cannot have a child because of a Witch's curse,
									the two set off on a journey to break the curse.
									Everyone's wish is granted, but the consequences of
									their actions return to haunt them later with
									disastrous results.<br><br>One of Sondheim's most
									popular works, <i>Into the Woods</i> is a musically
									sophisticated show with the opportunity to feature
									actors adept at dark comedy. Designers will
									especially enjoy highlighting the fantastical
									elements of this magical word.

									<i>Our Town</i> is a 1938 metatheatrical
									three-actplay by American playwright Thornton
									Wilder. It tells the story of the fictional American
									small town of Grover's Corners between 1901 and 1913
									through the everyday lives of its citizens.<br><br>
									Throughout, Wilder uses metatheatrical devices,
									setting the play in the actual theatre where it is
									being performed. The main character is the stage
									manager of the theatre who directly addresses the
									audience, brings in guest lecturers, fields
									questions from the audience, and fills in playing
									some of the roles. The play is performed without a
									set on a mostly bare stage. With a few exceptions,
									the actors mime actions without the use of props.
									<br><br>The first performance of <i>Our Town</i> was
									at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey on
									January 22, 1938. It went on to success on Broadway
									and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Described
									by Edward Albee it is "the greatest American play
									ever written". <i>Our Town</i> is popular today with
									frequent revivals.
